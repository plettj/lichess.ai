### Machine Learning Analysis

Below is a summary of the notable analysis we performed.

#### 1. Data transformation

We parsed each [PGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) and calculated the point where the middlegame and endgame began (based on [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish)'s strategies) for each game. We then computed the total thinking time of each player during all three periods of the game.

Other small adjustments were made too, like [standardizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) the data and including attributes like [Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) difference.

#### 2. Feature Extraction

In [Report 1](/lichess.ai/public/static/reports/feature-extraction-and-visualization.pdf) we performed [Principle Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) to see which attributes had the biggest effect on the final result of each game.

#### 3. Regression for predicting Game Length

This part is of interest to any avid blitz players. In [Report 2](/lichess.ai/public/static/reports/supervised-learning-classification-and-regression.pdf), we explored how well one could predict the total [plies](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ply_(game_theory)>) of their game based only on time spent during different periods of the game. [Regularization](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)>) was used to prevent overfitting. We discovered two interesting phenomenon.

First, a larger Elo difference between players actually indicates a (mildly) **increased** game length! This is because the stronger player intends to reduce variance in game outcome and therefore plays slower and more methodically.

Second, by getting a sense of purely how long (in clock time) the opening of your blitz chess game has taken, you can increase your prediction of game length (by plies)'s accuracy by over **20%**. Slower-moving openings lead to longer games!

These insights should help with [clock management](https://www.chess.com/article/view/the-art-of-time-management).

#### 4. Classification for predicting Game Outcome

Like Regression above, this section uses [two-layer](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_nested_cross_validation_iris.html) 10-fold [cross-validation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)>) to assess the strength of each [Classification Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) model trained on subsets of our data.

Interestingly, using Classification Trees on input like time usage throughout the game, one can predict the outcome of a game **1.19 times** better than purely looking at the Elo difference of the players. Specifically, the error rate decreases from **36.64%** to **30.70%**.
